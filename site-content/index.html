 <h1>How and Why I Built This Website&#63; #1</h1><br>

<h2>Welcome to my thoughts on developing a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-maur%C3%ADcio-portela-dutra-47829319/"><strong>DevOps Carreer</strong></a>. I am extremely driven to assist others in their self-improvement journey. In this guide, I will present various scenarios to help you discover the most suitable path for you in the competitive IT market.</h2>
<p>
<br>The DevOps implementation road map includes six steps:
  <br>
<br>#1-Show the DevOps Initiative. ...
<br>#2-Develop Your DevOps Strategy. ...
<br>#3-Containerize Your Applications. ...
<br>#4-Integrate Infrastructure with CI/CD Tools. ...
<br>#5-Automate More Tests and Align QA with Dev. ...
<br>#6-Monitor Application Performance.
</p>
  
<h2>Step 1: Planning</h2>
<p>Welcome to my tutorial on building a stunning website. In this guide, I will walk you through the process of creating a visually appealing website using HTML and CSS using <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">Docker Container Technology.</a></p>

<h2>Step 2: Creating the HTML Structure</h2>
<p>Start by creating the basic structure of your website using HTML tags. Use h1, h2, and h3 tags to create headings and subheadings that will help organize your content.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Styling with CSS</h2>
<p>Once you have the basic structure in place, use CSS to style your website and make it visually appealing. You can add background images, colors, fonts, and other design elements to enhance the look of your site.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Dive into the Code</h2>
<p>With the applications on your host using Docker and Docker Compose, let's begin by executing just two simple commands: <br>
<br>
1. git clone https://github.com/leonardodutra/cloudsolvd.com.git <br>
2. docker-compose up -d <br>

This will get you up and running quickly and efficiently.</p> 

<h2>Step 5: Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Congratulations! You now have a successful Docker deployment with Nginx running your application on TCP port localhost:80. Your project is up and running smoothly, ready for you to further explore and expand. Well done!
