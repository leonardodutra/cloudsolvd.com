 <h1>How and Why I Built This Website&#63; #1</h1><br>

<h2>Welcome to my thoughts on developing a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-maur%C3%ADcio-portela-dutra-47829319/"><strong>DevOps Carreer</strong></a>.

<p>Before you start building your website, it’s important to have a clear plan in mind. Think about the purpose of your website, who your target audience is, and what type of content you want to include.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Creating the HTML Structure</h2>
<p>Start by creating the basic structure of your website using HTML tags. Use h1, h2, and h3 tags to create headings and subheadings that will help organize your content.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Styling with CSS</h2>
<p>Once you have the basic structure in place, use CSS to style your website and make it visually appealing. You can add background images, colors, fonts, and other design elements to enhance the look of your site.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Put your hands on the Code</h2>
<p>With the Applications on your host(docker,docker-compose), lets get started running only two commands<br> git clone https://github.com/leonardodutra/cloudsolvd.com.git; docker-compose up -d</p> 

<h2>Step 5: Conclusion</h2>
<p>You have a complete docker deployment with nginx running you application in tcp port localhost:80</p>
